        <h2>General Info</h2>
        <p>
            PcapTracker is a full stack application made using Python's <a href="https://scapy.net/" target="_blank" rel="nohup">Scapy library</a> to help analyze user pcaps.
            Our Python scripts filter through user pcaps to gather packet tracking information, like where and when
            are packets being sent to or received from. We then visualize these finding on the front end using interactive
            graphs and maps.
        </p>

        <br/>

        <h2>Technical details</h2>

        <p>
            As mentioned before, this is a full stack project. The front end is built using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
            and we use an Apache web server to host it. The front end also makes use of the d3 library to different graphs based on
            information gathered from the inputted PCAP. These graphs can be scrolled through and interacted with by hovering over
            data points for more information.
        </p>

        <p>
            The backend for this application was done using Python. This is where we actually analyze the PCAPs sent to us by users
            with help from the Scapy library. This library essentially just made it easier to read through the PCAPs packet by packet,
            actually filtering through the packets for interesting information was done through custom functions. We are able to generate 
            an interactive world map showing where IPs are being sent to by using the <a href="https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/" target="_blank" rel="nohup">geoIP2 Api by MaxMind</a> 
            through a Python wrapper on this collected information.
        </p>

        <p>
            To actually call our Python scripts to generate this information we are running a Flask server at the endpoint /analyze.
            This Flask server is further loadbalanced with <a href="https://gunicorn.org/" target="_blank" rel="nohup">GUnicorn</a> as
            Flask is not to be used directly in a production enviorenment. GUnicorn solves the problem of Flask not 
            inherintly compatible with multithreading, meaning that GUnicorn is what allows two people couldn't simulataneously use our application.
